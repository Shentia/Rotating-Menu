        <p>
          Software development has a huge range of earning potential. Probably,
          this is the main reason for the recent surge in new IT job openings.
          According to LinkedInâ€™s list of the most in-demand jobs for 2021,
          software engineers are among the most coveted professionals this year.
          So the salient question arises: Is software development a lucrative
          career path? With this in mind, our team has performed in-depth
          research designed to uncover an average front end developer salary by
          country. We have also collected the data on the median back end
          developer salary in 2021. The geographical coverage includes such
          locations as the United States, Canada, and Ukraine, as well as other
          European hubs, Canada, and Australia. Our data builds on both global
          and local job boards and employer review sites, including Glassdoor,
          Payscale, and Talent.com.
